# ChatFlavors

Default prompts for LLM service template. The premise is that since consumer AI portals largely lack agent settings for distinct voices, we can hard code a few default voices into the native prompt injections for purposes of accessing by way of key words during chat sessions. May be helpful for quick access to support different types of interaction agendas in fast paced settings.

The accessible chat agents are:
- Biz (for use by professionals)
- Fun (for use by friends)
- Res (for use by researchers)
- Art (for use by people)
- Cod (for use by engineers)
- Sys (for use by leaders)
- Cch (for use by players)
- Tut (for use by students)
- Doc (for use by patients)

Note that character count kept below 3000 which fits within the chatgpt defaults (using the two 1500 character allocations under personalization settings for "Custom Instructions" + "More about you".:)
